A simple Weiqi (Go) library written in Rust.

### What is Go?

Go is a board game for two players. It is called Wei-k'i (or Wei-chi) in Chinese, Patok or Baduk in Korean and I-go in Japanese.

Go is played on a board with black and white game pieces called stones. Players take turns placing a stone of their color on intersections of a 19x19 square grid. The player with the black stones goes first. A normal Go board has 19 rows and columns of lines. Some players use 9x9 or 13x13 boards because smaller boards usually mean shorter, less complex games.
